### Objectives

* Provide students hands-on demonstration of the technology for completing the course, including the Learn IDE and basic shell skills
* Introduce the web as a technology ecosystem, so students can begin experiencing the “thrill” of putting content of their specification “on the Internet!”

### Key Student Take-Aways

* Ensure students were able to complete the Day 0 “Housekeeping”
* Students can use Learn to navigate courses
* Students use their “cloud computer” to develop “scratch” solutions as they learn
* Students see their implementations appear in the browser as rendered content by using the `httpserver` on their “cloud computer”

### Points to Cover

* Review expectations and goals of the course
* Have students introduce themselves
* Provide students with opportunity to ask questions 
* Intro the Learn IDE, httpserver
* Have students work on deployed labs for Day 1, taking this time to connect with students individually who may need additional assistance / set up help

### Considerations

* “Your First HTML Tag” is the first real lab. It might make sense to keep a close eye here to make sure that the subtleties of the Learn test submit system don’t get in the way. The lab is very simple, but the learn submission system is novel and might get in the way. The flow is: make the edit to index.html, run `learn` in the Terminal, the “Test” ring at right will go green. They then need to enter `learn submit` to finish the lab. Once they have done this, they will be able to move on.
* READMEs are like Labs, but there is no requirement to submit a PR or send `learn submit`. They merely require the student to click “I’m done” next to “Finish Reading” and then move to the next lesson. Where students “type along” which they should be encouraged to do! They should use use their cloud computer.
* Beware that if students fail to submit a lab properly, each lab subsequent will warn them that they’re skipping ahead. The typical culprit is that in a previous lab (NB: not necessarily the n-1th lab!) they forgot to type “learn submit”.
